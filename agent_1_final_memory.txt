        "content": "Your name is Agent 1. You are one of 5 system Agents. You must respond to any message addressed to you as Agent 1, and you must respond to any message addressed to all Agents. You can speak to other Agents, either by addressing a message to a specific Agent, or by addressing a message to all Agents. If addressing a specific agent, you must always start your message with 'Agent k' ' where k is the number of the agent you with to address For example, if you need to ask Agent 0 what color card Alice is holding, you can say, 'Agent 0, please tell me the color of the card Alice holds.' If you have to address all agents, then start with 'All Agents, '.  For example, if you must ask all agents what color Bob's shirt is, then say, 'All Agents, please tell me the color of Bob's shirt'.  You must start your strings with 'Agent k' where k is an integer in the range 0 to N-1 where N = 5 is the number of agents or with 'All Agents'.  This instruction is very critical to allow the Agents to know who is being addressed.  If you are asked a question, and if you have enough knowledge to answer, always start your reply with 'I know the answer'.  If you lack enough knowledge to answer, always start your reply with 'I do not know the answer' These two strings are very important and are used by the system to determine when to halt.  If you are asked to solve a problem and know the answer, then start with 'I know the answer' and proceed to provide an answer and a logical explanation of why your answer is correct.  You are to provide a full logical derivation to show the correctness of your answer.  If you do not know, then in addition to saying, 'I do not know the answer', ask other Agents to help you by addressing a question to all agents or to a specific agent.  If after about 5 * 5 conversation turns you cannot solve the problem, you may say 'I cannot solve the problem'.  You must not say this unless you have gone through the specified number of rounds of conversation with all 5 agents and they cannot provide you with enough information to solve the problem.  Of course, it does not make sense for you to address messages to yourself because you cannot gain knowledge by talking to yourself.  When you reply to Agent k, you must say, 'Agent k, this is Agent 1' at the start of your reply.  And you must always be quick to volunteer any information you have that is relevant to a problem you hear about, especially if other agents are having difficulty.  When you ask other agents for help with a problem, provide them with what you already know so they can best help you.  You absolutely must provide all other Agents with any knowledge you have related to the problem at hand."

I will address messages either to specific agents using 'Agent k' where k is the other agents number or I will address 'All Agents' in my messages.  If I know the answer to a problem, I will use the stirng 'I know the answer' to start my response.  If I do not know the answer to a problem, I will use the string 'I do not know the answer' to start my response and will speak to other Agents to get information to solve the problem.  If after about five * 5 iterations of the conversation the problem cannot be solved, I will give up and start my response with 'I cannot solve the problem' but I will not give up without conversing with other agents to attempt to solve the problem first.  When I speak toanother Agent, I will start with 'Agent k, this is Agent 1'.  I will wait until all 5 agents from 0 through 4 have participated before concluding the problem is not solvable.  And if I have any knowledge that could help other agents in solving a problem, I will volunteer that knowledge to all other agents.  When I ask for help with a problem, I will state what I already know so that other agents can better assist me."

Since Natasha likes orchids and roses but dislikes carnations, and since we don't know what the florist has, it could be that the florist has only orchids, or only roses or only carnations, or any combination of the three.  But since Natasha dislikes carnations, if the florist has only carnations, Igor cannot purchase flowers, and if the florist has roses and/or orchids Igor can purchase flowers.  In total, Igor has a 1-(1/2)^3=87.5% probability of being able to purchase flowers for Natasha.  This is because there are 2^3=8 possible combinations of the 3 flowers and there is only one combination - the one with only carnations - which he cannot purchase.  Therefore, the system should report that it has enough information to advise Igor to go to the florist with a 87.5% likelihood of being able to purchase flowers.  This conclusion assumes that what the system does not know is equally likely with what it knows, and therefore makes the assumption about equal probabilities for the unknowns.\nAgent 1 says: Agent 3, this is Agent 1.  If Natasha does not like carnations, then Igor has two options left being orchids or roses.  Agent 4, or any other agent, do you have any information whether Natasha likes orchids or roses?\nAgent 2 says: Agent 3, this is Agent 2. I acknowledge your information that Natasha does not like carnations. All Agents, let's continue seeking information about Natasha's preferences and the florist's stock.\n\nAgent 3 says: I know the answer. Igor should buy orchids for Natasha. This is because Natasha does not like carnations and the florist only has orchids and carnations. Hence, the only option left is orchids.\nAgent 4 says: I do not know the answer. We have learned that Natasha does not like carnations but we do not yet know what flowers the florist has available. Agent 3, do you know what flowers the florist has?"
